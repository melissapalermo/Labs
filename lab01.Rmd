This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE }
plot(cars)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
correlacao=cor(cars$speed, cars$dist)
correlacao=round(correlacao, digits = 4)
correlacao
```

`r correlacao`
